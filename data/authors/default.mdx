This is a space where I share ideas, reflections, and any subject I find relevant.
Without a fixed theme, but always with direct and authentic content. Follow along and feel free to interact.

  "The soul attracts that which it secretly harbors; that which it loves, and also that which it
  fears; it reaches the height of its most cherished aspirations and descends to the level of its
  impure desires, - and circumstances are the means by which the soul receives what is due to it."
